  "abstract": "  Recently, the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of\nprimordial fluctuations has received much attention. The abundance of PBHs\nformed during radiation domination is sensitive to the tail of the probability\ndistribution of primordial fluctuations. We quantify the level of fine-tuning\ndue to this sensitivity. For example, if the main source of dark matter is PBHs\nwith mass $10^{-12}M_\\odot$, then anthropic reasoning suggests that the dark\nmatter to baryon ratio should range between 1 and 300. For this to happen, the\nroot-mean-square amplitude of the curvature perturbation has to be fine-tuned\nwithin a $7.1\\%$ range. As another example, if the recently detected\ngravitational-wave events are to be explained by PBHs, the corresponding degree\nof fine-tuning is $3.8\\%$. We also find, however, that these fine-tunings can\nbe relaxed if the primordial fluctuations are highly non-Gaussian, or if the\nPBHs are formed during an early-matter-dominated phase. We also note that no\nfine-tuning is needed for the scenario of a reheating of the universe by\nevaporated PBHs with Planck-mass relics left to serve as dark matter.\n",
