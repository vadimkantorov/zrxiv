  "abstract": "  We introduce the heat method for computing the shortest geodesic distance to\na specified subset (e.g., point or curve) of a given domain. The heat method is\nrobust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair\nof standard linear elliptic problems. The method represents a significant\nbreakthrough in the practical computation of distance on a wide variety of\ngeometric domains, since the resulting linear systems can be prefactored once\nand subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance can be\nupdated via the heat method an order of magnitude faster than with\nstate-of-the-art methods while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. We\nprovide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact geodesic\ndistance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of\ndistance suitable for applications where more regularity is required.\n",
