  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a simple but effective graph-based agglomerative\nalgorithm, for clustering high-dimensional data. We explore the different roles\nof two fundamental concepts in graph theory, indegree and outdegree, in the\ncontext of clustering. The average indegree reflects the density near a sample,\nand the average outdegree characterizes the local geometry around a sample.\nBased on such insights, we define the affinity measure of clusters via the\nproduct of average indegree and average outdegree. The product-based affinity\nmakes our algorithm robust to noise. The algorithm has three main advantages:\ngood performance, easy implementation, and high computational efficiency. We\ntest the algorithm on two fundamental computer vision problems: image\nclustering and object matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it\noutperforms the state-of-the-arts in both applications.\n",
