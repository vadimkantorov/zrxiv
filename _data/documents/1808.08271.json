  "abstract": "  We describe the fundamental differential-geometric structures of information\nmanifolds, state the fundamental theorem of information geometry, and\nillustrate some uses of these information manifolds in information sciences.\nThe exposition is self-contained by concisely introducing the necessary\nconcepts of differential geometry with proofs omitted for brevity.\n",
