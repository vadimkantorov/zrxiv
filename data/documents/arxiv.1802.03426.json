  "abstract": "  UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold\nlearning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a\ntheoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The\nresult is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The\nUMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and\narguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time\nperformance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding\ndimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique\nfor machine learning.\n",
