  "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning has proven to be a powerful paradigm for leveraging\nunlabeled data to mitigate the reliance on large labeled datasets. In this\nwork, we unify the current dominant approaches for semi-supervised learning to\nproduce a new algorithm, MixMatch, that works by guessing low-entropy labels\nfor data-augmented unlabeled examples and mixing labeled and unlabeled data\nusing MixUp. We show that MixMatch obtains state-of-the-art results by a large\nmargin across many datasets and labeled data amounts. For example, on CIFAR-10\nwith 250 labels, we reduce error rate by a factor of 4 (from 38% to 11%) and by\na factor of 2 on STL-10. We also demonstrate how MixMatch can help achieve a\ndramatically better accuracy-privacy trade-off for differential privacy.\nFinally, we perform an ablation study to tease apart which components of\nMixMatch are most important for its success.",
