  "abstract": "Style transfer algorithms strive to render the content of one image using the\nstyle of another. We propose Style Transfer by Relaxed Optimal Transport and\nSelf-Similarity (STROTSS), a new optimization-based style transfer algorithm.\nWe extend our method to allow user-specified point-to-point or region-to-region\ncontrol over visual similarity between the style image and the output. Such\nguidance can be used to either achieve a particular visual effect or correct\nerrors made by unconstrained style transfer. In order to quantitatively compare\nour method to prior work, we conduct a large-scale user study designed to\nassess the style-content tradeoff across settings in style transfer algorithms.\nOur results indicate that for any desired level of content preservation, our\nmethod provides higher quality stylization than prior work.
