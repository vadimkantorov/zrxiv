  "abstract": "This paper demonstrates two novel methods to estimate the global SNR of\nspeech signals. In both methods, Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model\n(DNN-HMM) acoustic model used in speech recognition systems is leveraged for\nthe additional task of SNR estimation. In the first method, the entropy of the\nDNN-HMM output is computed. Recent work on bayesian deep learning has shown\nthat a DNN-HMM trained with dropout can be used to estimate model uncertainty\nby approximating it as a deep Gaussian process. In the second method, this\napproximation is used to obtain model uncertainty estimates. Noise specific\nregressors are used to predict the SNR from the entropy and model uncertainty.\nThe DNN-HMM is trained on GRID corpus and tested on different noise profiles\nfrom the DEMAND noise database at SNR levels ranging from -10 dB to 30 dB.",
