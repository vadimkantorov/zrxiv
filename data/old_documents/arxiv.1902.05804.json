  "abstract": "  T-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) is a widely used data\nvisualisation technique. It differs from its predecessor SNE by the\nlow-dimensional similarity kernel: the Gaussian kernel was replaced by the\nheavy-tailed Cauchy kernel, solving the \"crowding problem\" of SNE. Here, we\ndevelop an efficient implementation of t-SNE for a $t$-distribution kernel with\nan arbitrary degree of freedom $\\nu$, with $\\nu\\to\\infty$ corresponding to SNE\nand $\\nu=1$ corresponding to the standard t-SNE. Using theoretical analysis and\ntoy examples, we show that $\\nu<1$ can further reduce the crowding problem and\nreveal finer cluster structure that is invisible in standard t-SNE. We further\ndemonstrate the striking effect of heavier-tailed kernels on large real-life\ndata sets such as MNIST, single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and the HathiTrust\nlibrary. We use domain knowledge to confirm that the revealed clusters are\nmeaningful. Overall, we argue that modifying the tail heaviness of the t-SNE\nkernel can yield additional insight into the cluster structure of the data.\n",
