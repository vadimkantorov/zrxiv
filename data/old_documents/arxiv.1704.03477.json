  "abstract": "  We present sketch-rnn, a recurrent neural network (RNN) able to construct\nstroke-based drawings of common objects. The model is trained on thousands of\ncrude human-drawn images representing hundreds of classes. We outline a\nframework for conditional and unconditional sketch generation, and describe new\nrobust training methods for generating coherent sketch drawings in a vector\nformat.\n",
