  "abstract": "The deep image prior was recently introduced as a prior for natural images.\nIt represents images as the output of a convolutional network with random\ninputs. For \"inference\", gradient descent is performed to adjust network\nparameters to make the output match observations. This approach yields good\nperformance on a range of image reconstruction tasks. We show that the deep\nimage prior is asymptotically equivalent to a stationary Gaussian process prior\nin the limit as the number of channels in each layer of the network goes to\ninfinity, and derive the corresponding kernel. This informs a Bayesian approach\nto inference. We show that by conducting posterior inference using stochastic\ngradient Langevin we avoid the need for early stopping, which is a drawback of\nthe current approach, and improve results for denoising and impainting tasks.\nWe illustrate these intuitions on a number of 1D and 2D signal reconstruction\ntasks.",
