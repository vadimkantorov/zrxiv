  "abstract": "Currently, most speech processing techniques use magnitude spectrograms as\nfront-end and are therefore by default discarding part of the signal: the\nphase. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end learning\nmethod for speech denoising based on Wavenet. The proposed model adaptation\nretains Wavenet's powerful acoustic modeling capabilities, while significantly\nreducing its time-complexity by eliminating its autoregressive nature.\nSpecifically, the model makes use of non-causal, dilated convolutions and\npredicts target fields instead of a single target sample. The discriminative\nadaptation of the model we propose, learns in a supervised fashion via\nminimizing a regression loss. These modifications make the model highly\nparallelizable during both training and inference. Both computational and\nperceptual evaluations indicate that the proposed method is preferred to Wiener\nfiltering, a common method based on processing the magnitude spectrogram.",
