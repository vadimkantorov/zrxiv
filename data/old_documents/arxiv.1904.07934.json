  "abstract": "We tackle the problem of semantic boundary prediction, which aims to identify\npixels that belong to object(class) boundaries. We notice that relevant\ndatasets consist of a significant level of label noise, reflecting the fact\nthat precise annotations are laborious to get and thus annotators trade-off\nquality with efficiency. We aim to learn sharp and precise semantic boundaries\nby explicitly reasoning about annotation noise during training. We propose a\nsimple new layer and loss that can be used with existing learning-based\nboundary detectors. Our layer/loss enforces the detector to predict a maximum\nresponse along the normal direction at an edge, while also regularizing its\ndirection. We further reason about true object boundaries during training using\na level set formulation, which allows the network to learn from misaligned\nlabels in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments show that we improve over the\nCASENet backbone network by more than 4% in terms of MF(ODS) and 18.61% in\nterms of AP, outperforming all current state-of-the-art methods including those\nthat deal with alignment. Furthermore, we show that our learned network can be\nused to significantly improve coarse segmentation labels, lending itself as an\nefficient way to label new data.",
