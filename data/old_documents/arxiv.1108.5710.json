  "abstract": "We present alpha-expansion beta-shrink moves, a simple generalization of the\nwidely-used alpha-beta swap and alpha-expansion algorithms for approximate\nenergy minimization. We show that in a certain sense, these moves dominate both\nalpha-beta-swap and alpha-expansion moves, but unlike previous generalizations\nthe new moves require no additional assumptions and are still solvable in\npolynomial-time. We show promising experimental results with the new moves,\nwhich we believe could be used in any context where alpha-expansions are\ncurrently employed.",
