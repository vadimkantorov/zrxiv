  "abstract": "We introduce count-guided weakly supervised localization (C-WSL), an approach\nthat uses per-class object count as a new form of supervision to improve weakly\nsupervised localization (WSL). C-WSL uses a simple count-based region selection\nalgorithm to select high-quality regions, each of which covers a single object\ninstance during training, and improves existing WSL methods by training with\nthe selected regions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of C-WSL, we integrate\nit into two WSL architectures and conduct extensive experiments on VOC2007 and\nVOC2012. Experimental results show that C-WSL leads to large improvements in\nWSL and that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The results of annotation experiments on VOC2007\nsuggest that a modest extra time is needed to obtain per-class object counts\ncompared to labeling only object categories in an image. Furthermore, we reduce\nthe annotation time by more than $2\\times$ and $38\\times$ compared to\ncenter-click and bounding-box annotations.",
