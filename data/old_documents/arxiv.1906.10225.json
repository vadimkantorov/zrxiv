  "abstract": "We study a formalization of the grammar induction problem that models\nsentences as being generated by a compound probabilistic context-free grammar.\nIn contrast to traditional formulations which learn a single stochastic\ngrammar, our context-free rule probabilities are modulated by a per-sentence\ncontinuous latent variable, which induces marginal dependencies beyond the\ntraditional context-free assumptions. Inference in this grammar is performed by\ncollapsed variational inference, in which an amortized variational posterior is\nplaced on the continuous variable, and the latent trees are marginalized with\ndynamic programming. Experiments on English and Chinese show the effectiveness\nof our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods for grammar\ninduction from words with neural language models.",
