  "abstract": "This work tackles the problem of semi-supervised learning of image\nclassifiers. Our main insight is that the field of semi-supervised learning can\nbenefit from the quickly advancing field of self-supervised visual\nrepresentation learning. Unifying these two approaches, we propose the\nframework of self-supervised semi-supervised learning ($S^4L$) and use it to\nderive two novel semi-supervised image classification methods. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of these methods in comparison to both carefully tuned\nbaselines, and existing semi-supervised learning methods. We then show that\n$S^4L$ and existing semi-supervised methods can be jointly trained, yielding a\nnew state-of-the-art result on semi-supervised ILSVRC-2012 with 10% of labels.",
