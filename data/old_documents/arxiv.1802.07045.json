  "abstract": "We present a method that can evaluate a RANSAC hypothesis in constant time,\ni.e. independent of the size of the data. A key observation here is that\ncorrect hypotheses are tightly clustered together in the latent parameter\ndomain. In a manner similar to the generalized Hough transform we seek to find\nthis cluster, only that we need as few as two votes for a successful detection.\nRapidly locating such pairs of similar hypotheses is made possible by adapting\nthe recent \"Random Grids\" range-search technique. We only perform the usual\n(costly) hypothesis verification stage upon the discovery of a close pair of\nhypotheses. We show that this event rarely happens for incorrect hypotheses,\nenabling a significant speedup of the RANSAC pipeline. The suggested approach\nis applied and tested on three robust estimation problems: camera localization,\n3D rigid alignment and 2D-homography estimation. We perform rigorous testing on\nboth synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating an improvement in efficiency\nwithout a compromise in accuracy. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art 3D\nalignment results on the challenging \"Redwood\" loop-closure challenge.",
