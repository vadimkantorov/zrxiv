  "abstract": "The Lenz-Ising model has served for almost a century as a basis for\nunderstanding ferromagnetism, and has become a paradigmatic model for phase\ntransitions in statistical mechanics. While retaining the Ising energy\narguments, we use techniques previously applied to sociophysics to propose a\ncontinuum model. Our formulation results in an integro-differential equation\nthat has several advantages over the traditional version: it allows for\nasymptotic analysis of phase transitions, material properties, and the dynamics\nof the formation of magnetic domains.",
