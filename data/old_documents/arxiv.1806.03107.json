  "abstract": "  To act and plan in complex environments, we posit that agents should have a\nmental simulator of the world with three characteristics: (a) it should build\nan abstract state representing the condition of the world; (b) it should form a\nbelief which represents uncertainty on the world; (c) it should go beyond\nsimple step-by-step simulation, and exhibit temporal abstraction. Motivated by\nthe absence of a model satisfying all these requirements, we propose TD-VAE, a\ngenerative sequence model that learns representations containing explicit\nbeliefs about states several steps into the future, and that can be rolled out\ndirectly without single-step transitions. TD-VAE is trained on pairs of\ntemporally separated time points, using an analogue of temporal difference\nlearning used in reinforcement learning.\n",
