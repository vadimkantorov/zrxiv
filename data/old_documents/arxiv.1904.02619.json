  "abstract": "We propose a fully convolutional sequence-to-sequence encoder architecture\nwith a simple and efficient decoder. Our model improves WER on LibriSpeech\nwhile being an order of magnitude more efficient than a strong RNN baseline.\nKey to our approach is a time-depth separable convolution block which\ndramatically reduces the number of parameters in the model while keeping the\nreceptive field large. We also give a stable and efficient beam search\ninference procedure which allows us to effectively integrate a language model.\nCoupled with a convolutional language model, our time-depth separable\nconvolution architecture improves by more than 22% relative WER over the best\npreviously reported sequence-to-sequence results on the noisy LibriSpeech test\nset.",
