  "abstract": "Autoregressive generative models of images tend to be biased towards\ncapturing local structure, and as a result they often produce samples which are\nlacking in terms of large-scale coherence. To address this, we propose two\nmethods to learn discrete representations of images which abstract away local\ndetail. We show that autoregressive models conditioned on these representations\ncan produce high-fidelity reconstructions of images, and that we can train\nautoregressive priors on these representations that produce samples with\nlarge-scale coherence. We can recursively apply the learning procedure,\nyielding a hierarchy of progressively more abstract image representations. We\ntrain hierarchical class-conditional autoregressive models on the ImageNet\ndataset and demonstrate that they are able to generate realistic images at\nresolutions of 128$\\times$128 and 256$\\times$256 pixels.",
