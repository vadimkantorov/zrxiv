  "abstract": "This paper presents a novel phase reconstruction method (only from a given\namplitude spectrogram) by combining a signal-processing-based approach and a\ndeep neural network (DNN). To retrieve a time-domain signal from its amplitude\nspectrogram, the corresponding phase is required. One of the popular phase\nreconstruction methods is the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA), which is based on\nthe redundancy of the short-time Fourier transform. However, GLA often involves\nmany iterations and produces low-quality signals owing to the lack of prior\nknowledge of the target signal. In order to address these issues, in this\nstudy, we propose an architecture which stacks a sub-block including two\nGLA-inspired fixed layers and a DNN. The number of stacked sub-blocks is\nadjustable, and we can trade the performance and computational load based on\nrequirements of applications. The effectiveness of the proposed method is\ninvestigated by reconstructing phases from amplitude spectrograms of speeches.",
