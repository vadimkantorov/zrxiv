  "abstract": "A new convex formulation of data clustering and image segmentation is proposed, with fixed number K of regions and possible penalization of the region perimeters. So, this problem is a spatially regularized version of the K-means problem, a.k.a. piecewise constant Mumfordâ€“Shah problem. The proposed approach relies on a discretization of the search space; that is, a finite number of candidates must be specified, from which the K centroids are determined. After reformulation as an assignment problem, a convex relaxation is proposed, which involves a kind of l 1,infinity norm ball. A splitting of it is proposed, so as to avoid the costly projection onto this set. Some examples illustrate the efficiency of the approach.",
