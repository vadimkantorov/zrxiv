  "abstract": "  The problem of estimating discovery probabilities originated in the context\nof statistical ecology, and in recent years it has become popular due to its\nfrequent appearance in challenging applications arising in genetics,\nbioinformatics, linguistics, designs of experiments, machine learning, etc. A\nfull range of statistical approaches, parametric and nonparametric as well as\nfrequentist and Bayesian, has been proposed for estimating discovery\nprobabilities. In this paper we investigate the relationships between the\ncelebrated Good-Turing approach, which is a frequentist nonparametric approach\ndeveloped in the 1940s, and a Bayesian nonparametric approach recently\nintroduced in the literature. Specifically, under the assumption of a two\nparameter Poisson-Dirichlet prior, we show that Bayesian nonparametric\nestimators of discovery probabilities are asymptotically equivalent, for a\nlarge sample size, to suitably smoothed Good-Turing estimators. As a by-product\nof this result, we introduce and investigate a methodology for deriving exact\nand asymptotic credible intervals to be associated with the Bayesian\nnonparametric estimators of discovery probabilities. The proposed methodology\nis illustrated through a comprehensive simulation study and the analysis of\nExpressed Sequence Tags data generated by sequencing a benchmark complementary\nDNA library.\n",
