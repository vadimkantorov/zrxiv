  "abstract": "Convolutional networks have been the paradigm of choice in many computer\nvision applications. The convolution operation however has a significant\nweakness in that it only operates on a local neighborhood, thus missing global\ninformation. Self-attention, on the other hand, has emerged as a recent advance\nto capture long range interactions, but has mostly been applied to sequence\nmodeling and generative modeling tasks. In this paper, we consider the use of\nself-attention for discriminative visual tasks as an alternative to\nconvolutions. We introduce a novel two-dimensional relative self-attention\nmechanism that proves competitive in replacing convolutions as a stand-alone\ncomputational primitive for image classification. We find in control\nexperiments that the best results are obtained when combining both convolutions\nand self-attention. We therefore propose to augment convolutional operators\nwith this self-attention mechanism by concatenating convolutional feature maps\nwith a set of feature maps produced via self-attention. Extensive experiments\nshow that Attention Augmentation leads to consistent improvements in image\nclassification on ImageNet and object detection on COCO across many different\nmodels and scales, including ResNets and a state-of-the art mobile constrained\nnetwork, while keeping the number of parameters similar. In particular, our\nmethod achieves a $1.3\\%$ top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet classification\nover a ResNet50 baseline and outperforms other attention mechanisms for images\nsuch as Squeeze-and-Excitation. It also achieves an improvement of 1.4 mAP in\nCOCO Object Detection on top of a RetinaNet baseline.",
