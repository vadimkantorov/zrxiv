  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose the Quantile Option Architecture (QUOTA) for\nexploration based on recent advances in distributional reinforcement learning\n(RL). In QUOTA, decision making is based on quantiles of a value distribution,\nnot only the mean. QUOTA provides a new dimension for exploration via making\nuse of both optimism and pessimism of a value distribution. We demonstrate the\nperformance advantage of QUOTA in both challenging video games and physical\nrobot simulators.\n",
