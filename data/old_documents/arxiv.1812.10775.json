  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose 3D point-capsule networks, an auto-encoder designed\nto process sparse 3D point clouds while preserving spatial arrangements of the\ninput data. 3D capsule networks arise as a direct consequence of our novel\nunified 3D auto-encoder formulation. Their dynamic routing scheme and the\npeculiar 2D latent space deployed by our approach bring in improvements for\nseveral common point cloud-related tasks, such as object classification, object\nreconstruction and part segmentation as substantiated by our extensive\nevaluations. Moreover, it enables new applications such as part interpolation\nand replacement.\n",
