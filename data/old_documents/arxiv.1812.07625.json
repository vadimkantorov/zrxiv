  "abstract": "This paper introduces wav2letter++, the fastest open-source deep learning\nspeech recognition framework. wav2letter++ is written entirely in C++, and uses\nthe ArrayFire tensor library for maximum efficiency. Here we explain the\narchitecture and design of the wav2letter++ system and compare it to other\nmajor open-source speech recognition systems. In some cases wav2letter++ is\nmore than 2x faster than other optimized frameworks for training end-to-end\nneural networks for speech recognition. We also show that wav2letter++'s\ntraining times scale linearly to 64 GPUs, the highest we tested, for models\nwith 100 million parameters. High-performance frameworks enable fast iteration,\nwhich is often a crucial factor in successful research and model tuning on new\ndatasets and tasks.",
