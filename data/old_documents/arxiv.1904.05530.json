  "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in learning representation of\ngraph-structured data that are dynamically evolving. However, current dynamic\ngraph learning methods lack a principled way in modeling temporal,\nmulti-relational, and concurrent interactions between nodes---a limitation that\nis especially problematic for the task of temporal knowledge graph reasoning,\nwhere the goal is to predict unseen entity relationships (i.e., events) over\ntime. Here we present Recurrent Event Network (\\method)---an architecture for\nmodeling complex event sequences---which consists of a recurrent event encoder\nand a neighborhood aggregator. The event encoder employs a RNN to capture\n(subject, relation)-specific patterns from historical entity interactions;\nwhile the neighborhood aggregator summarizes concurrent interactions within\neach time stamp. An output layer is designed for predicting forthcoming,\nmulti-relational events. Experiments on temporal link prediction over two\nknowledge graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nespecially on multi-step inference over time.",
