  "abstract": "  We present Variational Aspect-Based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (VALDA), a\nfamily of autoencoding topic models that learn aspect-based representations of\nreviews. VALDA defines a user-item encoder that maps bag-of-words vectors for\ncombined reviews associated with each paired user and item onto structured\nembeddings, which in turn define per-aspect topic weights. We model individual\nreviews in a structured manner by inferring an aspect assignment for each\nsentence in a given review, where the per-aspect topic weights obtained by the\nuser-item encoder serve to define a mixture over topics, conditioned on the\naspect. The result is an autoencoding neural topic model for reviews, which can\nbe trained in a fully unsupervised manner to learn topics that are structured\ninto aspects. Experimental evaluation on large number of datasets demonstrates\nthat aspects are interpretable, yield higher coherence scores than\nnon-structured autoencoding topic model variants, and can be utilized to\nperform aspect-based comparison and genre discovery.\n",
