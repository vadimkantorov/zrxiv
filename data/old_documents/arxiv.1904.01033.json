  "abstract": "We present Multitask Soft Option Learning (MSOL), a hierarchical multitask\nframework based on Planning as Inference. MSOL extends the concept of options,\nusing separate variational posteriors for each task, regularized by a shared\nprior. This allows fine-tuning of options for new tasks without forgetting\ntheir learned policies, leading to faster training without reducing the\nexpressiveness of the hierarchical policy. Additionally, MSOL avoids several\ninstabilities during training in a multitask setting and provides a natural way\nto not only learn intra-option policies, but also their terminations. We\ndemonstrate empirically that MSOL significantly outperforms both hierarchical\nand flat transfer-learning baselines in challenging multi-task environments.",
