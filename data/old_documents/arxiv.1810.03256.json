  "abstract": "The Normalizing Flow (NF) models a general probability density by estimating\nan invertible transformation applied on samples drawn from a known\ndistribution. We introduce a new type of NF, called Deep Diffeomorphic\nNormalizing Flow (DDNF). A diffeomorphic flow is an invertible function where\nboth the function and its inverse are smooth. We construct the flow using an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) governed by a time-varying smooth vector\nfield. We use a neural network to parametrize the smooth vector field and a\nrecursive neural network (RNN) for approximating the solution of the ODE. Each\ncell in the RNN is a residual network implementing one Euler integration step.\nThe architecture of our flow enables efficient likelihood evaluation,\nstraightforward flow inversion, and results in highly flexible density\nestimation. An end-to-end trained DDNF achieves competitive results with\nstate-of-the-art methods on a suite of density estimation and variational\ninference tasks. Finally, our method brings concepts from Riemannian geometry\nthat, we believe, can open a new research direction for neural density\nestimation.",
