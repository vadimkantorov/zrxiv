  "abstract": "  The usual heat equation is not suitable to preserve the topology of\ndivergence-free vector fields, because it destroys their integral line\nstructure. On the contrary, in the fluid mechanics literature, on can find\nexamples of topology-preserving diffusion equations for divergence-free vector\nfields. They are very degenerate since they admit all stationary solutions to\nthe Euler equations of incompressible fluids as equilibrium points. For them,\nwe provide a suitable concept of \"dissipative solutions\", which shares common\nfeatures with both P.-L. Lions' dissipative solutions to the Euler equations\nand the concept of \"curves of maximal slopes\", a la De Giorgi, recently used to\nstudy the scalar heat equation in very general metric spaces.\n",
