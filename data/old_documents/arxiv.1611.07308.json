  "abstract": "  We introduce the variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE), a framework for\nunsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on the variational\nauto-encoder (VAE). This model makes use of latent variables and is capable of\nlearning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. We\ndemonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a\nsimple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link\nprediction task in citation networks. In contrast to most existing models for\nunsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model\ncan naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves\npredictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.\n",
