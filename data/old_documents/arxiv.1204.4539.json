  "abstract": "  We consider supervised learning problems where the features are embedded in a\ngraph, such as gene expressions in a gene network. In this context, it is of\nmuch interest to automatically select a subgraph with few connected components;\nby exploiting prior knowledge, one can indeed improve the prediction\nperformance or obtain results that are easier to interpret. Regularization or\npenalty functions for selecting features in graphs have recently been proposed,\nbut they raise new algorithmic challenges. For example, they typically require\nsolving a combinatorially hard selection problem among all connected subgraphs.\nIn this paper, we propose computationally feasible strategies to select a\nsparse and well-connected subset of features sitting on a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG). We introduce structured sparsity penalties over paths on a DAG\ncalled \"path coding\" penalties. Unlike existing regularization functions that\nmodel long-range interactions between features in a graph, path coding\npenalties are tractable. The penalties and their proximal operators involve\npath selection problems, which we efficiently solve by leveraging network flow\noptimization. We experimentally show on synthetic, image, and genomic data that\nour approach is scalable and leads to more connected subgraphs than other\nregularization functions for graphs.\n",
