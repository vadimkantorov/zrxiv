  "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) transform latent vectors into visually\nplausible images. It is generally thought that the original GAN formulation\ngives no out-of-the-box method to reverse the mapping, projecting images back\ninto latent space. We introduce a simple, gradient-based technique called\nstochastic clipping. In experiments, for images generated by the GAN, we\nprecisely recover their latent vector pre-images 100% of the time. Additional\nexperiments demonstrate that this method is robust to noise. Finally, we show\nthat even for unseen images, our method appears to recover unique encodings.",
