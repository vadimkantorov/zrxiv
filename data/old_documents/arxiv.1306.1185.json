  "abstract": "  Ideas from the image processing literature have recently motivated a new set\nof clustering algorithms that rely on the concept of total variation. While\nthese algorithms perform well for bi-partitioning tasks, their recursive\nextensions yield unimpressive results for multiclass clustering tasks. This\npaper presents a general framework for multiclass total variation clustering\nthat does not rely on recursion. The results greatly outperform previous total\nvariation algorithms and compare well with state-of-the-art NMF approaches.\n",
