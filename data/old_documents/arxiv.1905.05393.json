  "abstract": "A key challenge in leveraging data augmentation for neural network training\nis choosing an effective augmentation policy from a large search space of\ncandidate operations. Properly chosen augmentation policies can lead to\nsignificant generalization improvements; however, state-of-the-art approaches\nsuch as AutoAugment are computationally infeasible to run for the ordinary\nuser. In this paper, we introduce a new data augmentation algorithm, Population\nBased Augmentation (PBA), which generates nonstationary augmentation policy\nschedules instead of a fixed augmentation policy. We show that PBA can match\nthe performance of AutoAugment on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with three\norders of magnitude less overall compute. On CIFAR-10 we achieve a mean test\nerror of 1.46%, which is a slight improvement upon the current\nstate-of-the-art. The code for PBA is open source and is available at\nhttps://github.com/arcelien/pba.",
