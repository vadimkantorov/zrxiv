  "abstract": "Generative models are often used to sample high-dimensional data points from\na manifold with small intrinsic dimension. Existing techniques for comparing\ngenerative models focus on global data properties such as mean and covariance;\nin that sense, they are extrinsic and uni-scale. We develop the first, to our\nknowledge, intrinsic and multi-scale method for characterizing and comparing\nunderlying data manifolds, based on comparing all data moments by\nlower-bounding the spectral notion of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between\nmanifolds. In a thorough experimental study, we demonstrate that our method\neffectively evaluates the quality of generative models; further, we showcase\nits efficacy in discerning the disentanglement process in neural networks.",
