  "abstract": "  In the continuum, close connections exist between mean curvature flow, the\nAllen-Cahn (AC) partial differential equation, and the Merriman-Bence-Osher\n(MBO) threshold dynamics scheme. Graph analogues of these processes have\nrecently seen a rise in popularity as relaxations of NP-complete combinatorial\nproblems, which demands deeper theoretical underpinnings of the graph\nprocesses. The aim of this paper is to introduce these graph processes in the\nlight of their continuum counterparts, provide some background, prove the first\nresults connecting them, illustrate these processes with examples and identify\nopen questions for future study. We derive a graph curvature from the graph cut\nfunction, the natural graph counterpart of total variation (perimeter). This\nderivation and the resulting curvature definition differ from those in earlier\nliterature, where the continuum mean curvature is simply discretized, and bears\nmany similarities to the continuum nonlocal curvature or nonlocal means\nformulation. This new graph curvature is not only relevant for graph MBO\ndynamics, but also appears in the variational formulation of a discrete time\ngraph mean curvature flow. We prove estimates showing that the dynamics are\ntrivial for both MBO and AC evolutions if the parameters (the time-step and\ndiffuse interface scale, respectively) are sufficiently small (a phenomenon\nknown as \"freezing\" or \"pinning\") and also that the dynamics for MBO are\nnontrivial if the time step is large enough. These bounds are in terms of graph\nquantities such as the spectrum of the graph Laplacian and the graph curvature.\nAdapting a Lyapunov functional for the continuum MBO scheme to graphs, we prove\nthat the graph MBO scheme converges to a stationary state in a finite number of\niterations. Variations on this scheme have recently become popular in the\nliterature as ways to minimize (continuum) nonlocal total variation.\n",
