  "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on learning structure-aware document representations\nfrom data without recourse to a discourse parser or additional annotations.\nDrawing inspiration from recent efforts to empower neural networks with a\nstructural bias, we propose a model that can encode a document while\nautomatically inducing rich structural dependencies. Specifically, we embed a\ndifferentiable non-projective parsing algorithm into a neural model and use\nattention mechanisms to incorporate the structural biases. Experimental\nevaluation across different tasks and datasets shows that the proposed model\nachieves state-of-the-art results on document modeling tasks while inducing\nintermediate structures which are both interpretable and meaningful.",
