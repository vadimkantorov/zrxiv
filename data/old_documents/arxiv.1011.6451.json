  "abstract": "  Quantum theory can be derived from purely informational principles. Five\nelementary axioms-causality, perfect distinguishability, ideal compression,\nlocal distinguishability, and pure conditioning-define a broad class of\ntheories of information-processing that can be regarded as a standard. One\npostulate-purification-singles out quantum theory within this class. The main\nstructures of quantum theory, such as the representation of mixed states as\nconvex combinations of perfectly distinguishable pure states, are derived\ndirectly from the principles without using the Hilbert space framework.\n",
