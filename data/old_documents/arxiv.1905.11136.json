  "abstract": "Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to\nmeasure the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNN). It was shown that\nthe popular message passing GNN cannot distinguish between graphs that are\nindistinguishable by the 1-WL test (Morris et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019).\nUnfortunately, many simple instances of graphs are indistinguishable by the\n1-WL test.\n  In search for more expressive graph learning models we build upon the recent\nk-order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks (Maron et al. 2019a,b)\nand present two results:\n  First, we show that such k-order networks can distinguish between\nnon-isomorphic graphs as good as the k-WL tests, which are provably stronger\nthan the 1-WL test for k>2. This makes these models strictly stronger than\nmessage passing models. Unfortunately, the higher expressiveness of these\nmodels comes with a computational cost of processing high order tensors.\n  Second, setting our goal at building a provably stronger, simple and scalable\nmodel we show that a reduced 2-order network containing just scaled identity\noperator, augmented with a single quadratic operation (matrix multiplication)\nhas a provable 3-WL expressive power. Differently put, we suggest a simple\nmodel that interleaves applications of standard Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP)\napplied to the feature dimension and matrix multiplication. We validate this\nmodel by presenting state of the art results on popular graph classification\nand regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical\ninvariant/equivariant model with guaranteed 3-WL expressiveness, strictly\nstronger than message passing models.",
