  "abstract": "This paper seeks to model human language by the mathematical framework of\nquantum physics. With the well-designed mathematical formulations in quantum\nphysics, this framework unifies different linguistic units in a single\ncomplex-valued vector space, e.g. words as particles in quantum states and\nsentences as mixed systems. A complex-valued network is built to implement this\nframework for semantic matching. With well-constrained complex-valued\ncomponents, the network admits interpretations to explicit physical meanings.\nThe proposed complex-valued network for matching (CNM) achieves comparable\nperformances to strong CNN and RNN baselines on two benchmarking question\nanswering (QA) datasets.",
