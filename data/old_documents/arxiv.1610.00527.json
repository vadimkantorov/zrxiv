  "abstract": "We propose a probabilistic video model, the Video Pixel Network (VPN), that\nestimates the discrete joint distribution of the raw pixel values in a video.\nThe model and the neural architecture reflect the time, space and color\nstructure of video tensors and encode it as a four-dimensional dependency\nchain. The VPN approaches the best possible performance on the Moving MNIST\nbenchmark, a leap over the previous state of the art, and the generated videos\nshow only minor deviations from the ground truth. The VPN also produces\ndetailed samples on the action-conditional Robotic Pushing benchmark and\ngeneralizes to the motion of novel objects.",
