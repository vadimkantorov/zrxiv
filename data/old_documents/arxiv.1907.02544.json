  "abstract": "Adversarially trained generative models (GANs) have recently achieved\ncompelling image synthesis results. But despite early successes in using GANs\nfor unsupervised representation learning, they have since been superseded by\napproaches based on self-supervision. In this work we show that progress in\nimage generation quality translates to substantially improved representation\nlearning performance. Our approach, BigBiGAN, builds upon the state-of-the-art\nBigGAN model, extending it to representation learning by adding an encoder and\nmodifying the discriminator. We extensively evaluate the representation\nlearning and generation capabilities of these BigBiGAN models, demonstrating\nthat these generation-based models achieve the state of the art in unsupervised\nrepresentation learning on ImageNet, as well as in unconditional image\ngeneration.",
