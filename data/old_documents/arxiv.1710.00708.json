  "abstract": "  How can dense biological tissue maintain sharp boundaries between coexisting\ncell populations? We explore this question within a simple vertex model for\ncells, focusing on the role of topology and tissue surface tension. We show\nthat the ability of cells to independently regulate adhesivity and tension,\ntogether with neighbor-based interaction rules, lets them support strikingly\nunusual interfaces. In particular, we show that mechanical- and\nfluctuation-based measurements of the effective surface tension of a cellular\naggregate yield different results, leading to mechanically soft interfaces that\nare nevertheless extremely sharp.\n",
