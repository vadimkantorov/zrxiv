  "abstract": "An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine\ntranslation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence\nduring translation. However, there has been little work exploring useful\narchitectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and\neffective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always\nattends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of\nsource words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches\nover the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions.\nWith local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over\nnon-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as\ndropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has\nestablished a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German\ntranslation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over\nthe existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.",
