  "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging problem of retrieval and matching of\ngraph structured objects, and makes two key contributions. First, we\ndemonstrate how Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which have emerged as an effective\nmodel for various supervised prediction problems defined on structured data,\ncan be trained to produce embedding of graphs in vector spaces that enables\nefficient similarity reasoning. Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching\nNetwork model that, given a pair of graphs as input, computes a similarity\nscore between them by jointly reasoning on the pair through a new cross-graph\nattention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodels on different domains including the challenging problem of\ncontrol-flow-graph based function similarity search that plays an important\nrole in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental\nanalysis demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in\nthe context of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain-specific\nbaseline systems that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.",
