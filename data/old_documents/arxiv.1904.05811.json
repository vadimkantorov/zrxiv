  "abstract": "We investigate Relational Graph Attention Networks, a class of models that\nextends non-relational graph attention mechanisms to incorporate relational\ninformation, opening up these methods to a wider variety of problems. A\nthorough evaluation of these models is performed, and comparisons are made\nagainst established benchmarks. To provide a meaningful comparison, we retrain\nRelational Graph Convolutional Networks, the spectral counterpart of Relational\nGraph Attention Networks, and evaluate them under the same conditions. We find\nthat Relational Graph Attention Networks perform worse than anticipated,\nalthough some configurations are marginally beneficial for modelling molecular\nproperties. We provide insights as to why this may be, and suggest both\nmodifications to evaluation strategies, as well as directions to investigate\nfor future work.",
