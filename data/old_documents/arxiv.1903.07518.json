  "abstract": "We consider the problem of path inference: given a path prefix, i.e., a\npartially observed sequence of nodes in a graph, we want to predict which nodes\nare in the missing suffix. In particular, we focus on natural paths occurring\nas a by-product of the interaction of an agent with a network---a driver on the\ntransportation network, an information seeker in Wikipedia, or a client in an\nonline shop. Our interest is sparked by the realization that, in contrast to\nshortest-path problems, natural paths are usually not optimal in any\ngraph-theoretic sense, but might still follow predictable patterns.\n  Our main contribution is a graph neural network called Gretel. Conditioned on\na path prefix, this network can efficiently extrapolate path suffixes, evaluate\npath likelihood, and sample from the future path distribution. Our experiments\nwith GPS traces on a road network and user-navigation paths in Wikipedia\nconfirm that Gretel is able to adapt to graphs with very different properties,\nwhile also comparing favorably to previous solutions.",
