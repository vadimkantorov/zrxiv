  "abstract": "This paper presents a study of semi-supervised learning with large\nconvolutional networks. We propose a pipeline, based on a teacher/student\nparadigm, that leverages a large collection of unlabelled images (up to 1\nbillion). Our main goal is to improve the performance for a given target\narchitecture, like ResNet-50 or ResNext. We provide an extensive analysis of\nthe success factors of our approach, which leads us to formulate some\nrecommendations to produce high-accuracy models for image classification with\nsemi-supervised learning. As a result, our approach brings important gains to\nstandard architectures for image, video and fine-grained classification. For\ninstance, by leveraging one billion unlabelled images, our learned vanilla\nResNet-50 achieves 81.2% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark.",
