  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures\nthat use Capsule Networks for image-synthesis. Based on the principal of\npositional-equivariance of features, Capsule Network's ability to encode\nspatial relationships between the features of the image helps it become a more\npowerful critic in comparison to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in\ncurrent architectures for image synthesis. Our proposed GAN architectures learn\nthe data manifold much faster and therefore, synthesize visually accurate\nimages in significantly lesser number of training samples and training epochs\nin comparison to GANs and its variants that use CNNs. Apart from analyzing the\nquantitative results corresponding the images generated by different\narchitectures, we also explore the reasons for the lower coverage and diversity\nexplored by the GAN architectures that use CNN critics.",
