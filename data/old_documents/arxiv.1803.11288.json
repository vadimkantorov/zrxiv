  "abstract": "  We discuss and predict the evolution of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping\n(SLAM) into a general geometric and semantic `Spatial AI' perception capability\nfor intelligent embodied devices. A big gap remains between the visual\nperception performance that devices such as augmented reality eyewear or\ncomsumer robots will require and what is possible within the constraints\nimposed by real products. Co-design of algorithms, processors and sensors will\nbe needed. We explore the computational structure of current and future Spatial\nAI algorithms and consider this within the landscape of ongoing hardware\ndevelopments.\n",
