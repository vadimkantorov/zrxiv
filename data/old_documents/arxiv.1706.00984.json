  "abstract": "A novel method for robust estimation, called Graph-Cut RANSAC, GC-RANSAC in\nshort, is introduced. To separate inliers and outliers, it runs the graph-cut\nalgorithm in the local optimization (LO) step which is applied when a\nso-far-the-best model is found. The proposed LO step is conceptually simple,\neasy to implement, globally optimal and efficient. GC-RANSAC is shown\nexperimentally, both on synthesized tests and real image pairs, to be more\ngeometrically accurate than state-of-the-art methods on a range of problems,\ne.g. line fitting, homography, affine transformation, fundamental and essential\nmatrix estimation. It runs in real-time for many problems at a speed\napproximately equal to that of the less accurate alternatives (in milliseconds\non standard CPU).",
