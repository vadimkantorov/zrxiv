  "abstract": "  In order to understand the mechanisms for glassy dynamics in biological\ntissues and shed light on those in non-biological materials, we study the\nlow-temperature disordered phase of 2D vertex-like models. Recently it has been\nnoted that vertex models have quite unusual behavior in the zero-temperature\nlimit, with rigidity transitions that are controlled by residual stresses and\ntherefore exhibit very different scaling and phenomenology compared to\nparticulate systems. Here we investigate the finite-temperature phase of\ntwo-dimensional Voronoi and Vertex models, and show that they have highly\nunusual, sub-Arrhenius scaling of dynamics with temperature. We connect the\nanomalous glassy dynamics to features of the potential energy landscape\nassociated with zero-temperature inherent states.\n",
