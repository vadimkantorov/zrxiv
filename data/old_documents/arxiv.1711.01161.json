  "abstract": "  We train a bank of complex filters that operates on the raw waveform and is\nfed into a convolutional neural network for end-to-end phone recognition. These\ntime-domain filterbanks (TD-filterbanks) are initialized as an approximation of\nmel-filterbanks, and then fine-tuned jointly with the remaining convolutional\narchitecture. We perform phone recognition experiments on TIMIT and show that\nfor several architectures, models trained on TD-filterbanks consistently\noutperform their counterparts trained on comparable mel-filterbanks. We get our\nbest performance by learning all front-end steps, from pre-emphasis up to\naveraging. Finally, we observe that the filters at convergence have an\nasymmetric impulse response, and that some of them remain almost analytic.\n",
