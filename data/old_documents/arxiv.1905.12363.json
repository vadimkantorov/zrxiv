  "abstract": "Data-driven model training is increasingly relying on finding Nash equilibria\nwith provable techniques, e.g., for GANs and multi-agent RL. In this paper, we\nanalyse a new extra-gradient method, that performs gradient extrapolations and\nupdates on a random subset of players at each iteration. This approach provably\nexhibits the same rate of convergence as full extra-gradient in non-smooth\nconvex games. We propose an additional variance reduction mechanism for this to\nhold for smooth convex games. Our approach makes extrapolation amenable to\nmassive multiplayer settings, and brings empirical speed-ups, in particular\nwhen using cyclic sampling schemes. We demonstrate the efficiency of player\nsampling on large-scale non-smooth and non-strictly convex games. We show that\nthe joint use of extrapolation and player sampling allows to train better GANs\non CIFAR10.",
