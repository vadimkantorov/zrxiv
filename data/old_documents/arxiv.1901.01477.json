  "abstract": "Convex clustering is a promising new approach to the classical problem of\nclustering, combining strong performance in empirical studies with rigorous\ntheoretical foundations. Despite these advantages, convex clustering has not\nbeen widely adopted, due to its computationally intensive nature and its lack\nof compelling visualizations. To address these impediments, we introduce\nAlgorithmic Regularization, an innovative technique for obtaining high-quality\nestimates of regularization paths using an iterative one-step approximation\nscheme. We justify our approach with a novel theoretical result, guaranteeing\nglobal convergence of the approximate path to the exact solution under\neasily-checked non-data-dependent assumptions. The application of algorithmic\nregularization to convex clustering yields the Convex Clustering via\nAlgorithmic Regularization Paths (CARP) algorithm for computing the clustering\nsolution path. On example data sets from genomics and text analysis, CARP\ndelivers over a 100-fold speed-up over existing methods, while attaining a\nfiner approximation grid than standard methods. Furthermore, CARP enables\nimproved visualization of clustering solutions: the fine solution grid returned\nby CARP can be used to construct a convex clustering-based dendrogram, as well\nas forming the basis of a dynamic path-wise visualization based on modern web\ntechnologies. Our methods are implemented in the open-source R package\nclustRviz, available at https://github.com/DataSlingers/clustRviz.",
