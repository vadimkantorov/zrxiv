  "abstract": "We study the problem of predicting a set from a feature vector with a deep\nneural network. Existing approaches ignore the set structure of the problem and\nsuffer from discontinuity issues as a result. We propose a general model for\npredicting sets that properly respects the structure of sets and avoids this\nproblem. With a single feature vector as input, we show that our model is able\nto auto-encode point sets, predict bounding boxes of the set of objects in an\nimage, and predict the attributes of these objects in an image.",
