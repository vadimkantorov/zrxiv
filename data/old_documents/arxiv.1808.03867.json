  "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art machine translation systems are based on\nencoder-decoder architectures, that first encode the input sequence, and then\ngenerate an output sequence based on the input encoding. Both are interfaced\nwith an attention mechanism that recombines a fixed encoding of the source\ntokens based on the decoder state. We propose an alternative approach which\ninstead relies on a single 2D convolutional neural network across both\nsequences. Each layer of our network re-codes source tokens on the basis of the\noutput sequence produced so far. Attention-like properties are therefore\npervasive throughout the network. Our model yields excellent results,\noutperforming state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems, while being\nconceptually simpler and having fewer parameters.",
