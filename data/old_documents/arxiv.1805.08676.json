  "abstract": "We propose a geometric convexity shape prior preservation method for\nvariational level set based image segmentation methods. Our method is built\nupon the fact that the level set of a convex signed distanced function must be\nconvex. This property enables us to transfer a complicated geometrical\nconvexity prior into a simple inequality constraint on the function. An active\nset based Gauss-Seidel iteration is used to handle this constrained\nminimization problem to get an efficient algorithm. We apply our method to\nregion and edge based level set segmentation models including Chan-Vese (CV)\nmodel with guarantee that the segmented region will be convex. Experimental\nresults show the effectiveness and quality of the proposed model and algorithm.",
