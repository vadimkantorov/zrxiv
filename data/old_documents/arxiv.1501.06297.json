  "abstract": "Feature descriptors play a crucial role in a wide range of geometry analysis\nand processing applications, including shape correspondence, retrieval, and\nsegmentation. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (GCNN), a generalization of the convolutional networks (CNN) paradigm\nto non-Euclidean manifolds. Our construction is based on a local geodesic\nsystem of polar coordinates to extract \"patches\", which are then passed through\na cascade of filters and linear and non-linear operators. The coefficients of\nthe filters and linear combination weights are optimization variables that are\nlearned to minimize a task-specific cost function. We use GCNN to learn\ninvariant shape features, allowing to achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nproblems such as shape description, retrieval, and correspondence.",
