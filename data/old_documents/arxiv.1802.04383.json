  "abstract": "  We present an extension of the cut-pursuit algorithm, introduced by Landrieu\nand Obozinski (2017), to the graph total-variation regularization of functions\nwith a separable nondifferentiable part. We propose a modified algorithmic\nscheme as well as adapted proofs of convergence. We also present a heuristic\napproach for handling the cases in which the values associated to each vertex\nof the graph are multidimensional. The performance of our algorithm, which we\ndemonstrate on difficult, ill-conditioned large-scale inverse and learning\nproblems, is such that it may in practice extend the scope of application of\nthe total-variation regularization.\n",
