  "abstract": "We propose a general framework for denoising high-dimensional measurements\nwhich requires no prior on the signal, no estimate of the noise, and no clean\ntraining data. The only assumption is that the noise exhibits statistical\nindependence across different dimensions of the measurement. Moreover, our\nframework is not restricted to a particular denoising model. We show how it can\nbe used to calibrate any parameterised denoising algorithm, from the single\nhyperparameter of a median filter to the millions of weights of a deep neural\nnetwork. We demonstrate this on natural image and microscopy data, where we\nexploit noise independence between pixels, and on single-cell gene expression\ndata, where we exploit independence between detections of individual molecules.\nFinally, we prove a theoretical lower bound on the performance of an optimal\ndenoiser. This framework generalizes recent work on training neural nets from\nnoisy images and on cross-validation for matrix factorization.",
