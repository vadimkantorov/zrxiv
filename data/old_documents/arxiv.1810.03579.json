  "abstract": "  Changes to network structure can substantially affect when and how widely new\nideas, products, and conventions are adopted. In models of biological\ncontagion, interventions that randomly rewire edges (making them \"longer\")\naccelerate spread. However, there are other models relevant to social\ncontagion, such as those motivated by myopic best-response in games with\nstrategic complements, in which individual's behavior is described by a\nthreshold number of adopting neighbors above which adoption occurs (i.e.,\ncomplex contagions). Recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather than\nrandom, networks facilitate spread of these complex contagions. Here we show\nthat minor modifications of prior analyses, which make them more realistic,\nreverse this result. The modification is that we allow very rarely below\nthreshold adoption, i.e., very rarely adoption occurs, where there is only one\nadopting neighbor. To model the trade-off between long and short edges we\nconsider networks that are the union of cycle-power-$k$ graphs and random\ngraphs on $n$ nodes. We study how the time to global spread changes as we\nreplace the cycle edges with (random) long ties. Allowing adoptions below\nthreshold to occur with order $1/\\sqrt{n}$ probability is enough to ensure that\nrandom rewiring accelerates spread. Simulations illustrate the robustness of\nthese results to other commonly-posited models for noisy best-response\nbehavior. We then examine empirical social networks, where we find that\nhypothetical interventions that (a) randomly rewire existing edges or (b) add\nrandom edges reduce time to spread compared with the original network or\naddition of \"short\", triad-closing edges, respectively. This substantially\nrevises conclusions about how interventions change the spread of behavior,\nsuggesting that those wanting to increase spread should induce formation of\nlong ties, rather than triad-closing ties.\n",
