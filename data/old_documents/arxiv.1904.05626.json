  "abstract": "Neural density estimators are flexible families of parametric models which\nhave seen widespread use in unsupervised machine learning in recent years.\nMaximum-likelihood training typically dictates that these models be constrained\nto specify an explicit density. However, this limitation can be overcome by\ninstead using a neural network to specify an energy function, or unnormalized\ndensity, which can subsequently be normalized to obtain a valid distribution.\nThe challenge with this approach lies in accurately estimating the normalizing\nconstant of the high-dimensional energy function. We propose the Autoregressive\nEnergy Machine, an energy-based model which simultaneously learns an\nunnormalized density and computes an importance-sampling estimate of the\nnormalizing constant for each conditional in an autoregressive decomposition.\nThe Autoregressive Energy Machine achieves state-of-the-art performance on a\nsuite of density-estimation tasks.",
