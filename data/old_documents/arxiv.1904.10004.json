  "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks allow us to keep track of uncertainties, for example\nin top tagging, by learning a tagger output together with an error band. We\nillustrate the main features of Bayesian versions of established deep-learning\ntaggers. We show how they capture statistical uncertainties from finite\ntraining samples, systematics related to the jet energy scale, and stability\nissues through pile-up. Altogether, Bayesian networks offer many new handles to\nunderstand and control deep learning at the LHC without introducing a visible\nprior effect and without compromising the network performance.",
