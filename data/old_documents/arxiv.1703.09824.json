  "abstract": "  The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a well-known algorithm for detecting and\ncharacterizing periodic signals in unevenly-sampled data. This paper presents a\nconceptual introduction to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and important practical\nconsiderations for its use. Rather than a rigorous mathematical treatment, the\ngoal of this paper is to build intuition about what assumptions are implicit in\nthe use of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and related estimators of periodicity,\nso as to motivate important practical considerations required in its proper\napplication and interpretation.\n",
