  "abstract": "How can one perform Bayesian inference on stochastic simulators with\nintractable likelihoods? A recent approach is to learn the posterior from\nadaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density\nestimators. However, existing methods are limited to a narrow range of proposal\ndistributions or require importance weighting that can limit performance in\npractice. Here we present automatic posterior transformation (APT), a new\nsequential neural posterior estimation method for simulation-based inference.\nAPT can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary, dynamically updated\nproposals, and is compatible with powerful flow-based density estimators. It is\nmore flexible, scalable and efficient than previous simulation-based inference\ntechniques. APT can operate directly on high-dimensional time series and image\ndata, opening up new applications for likelihood-free inference.",
