  "abstract": "We construct targeted audio adversarial examples on automatic speech\nrecognition. Given any audio waveform, we can produce another that is over\n99.9% similar, but transcribes as any phrase we choose (recognizing up to 50\ncharacters per second of audio). We apply our white-box iterative\noptimization-based attack to Mozilla's implementation DeepSpeech end-to-end,\nand show it has a 100% success rate. The feasibility of this attack introduce a\nnew domain to study adversarial examples.",
