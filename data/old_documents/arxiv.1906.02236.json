  "abstract": "Current meta-learning approaches focus on learning functional representations\nof relationships between variables, i.e. on estimating conditional expectations\nin regression. In many applications, however, we are faced with conditional\ndistributions which cannot be meaningfully summarized using expectation only\n(due to e.g. multimodality). Hence, we consider the problem of conditional\ndensity estimation in the meta-learning setting. We introduce a novel technique\nfor meta-learning which combines neural representation and noise-contrastive\nestimation with the established literature of conditional mean embeddings into\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The method is validated on synthetic and\nreal-world problems, demonstrating the utility of sharing learned\nrepresentations across multiple conditional density estimation tasks.",
