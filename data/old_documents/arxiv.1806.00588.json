  "abstract": "We present a GPU-based Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm to speed up\nbeam search for sequence models. We utilize the winner-take-all (WTA) hash,\nwhich is based on relative ranking order of hidden dimensions and thus\nresilient to perturbations in numerical values. Our algorithm is designed by\nfully considering the underling architecture of CUDA-enabled GPUs\n(Algorithm/Architecture Co-design): 1) A parallel Cuckoo hash table is applied\nfor LSH code lookup (guaranteed O(1) lookup time); 2) Candidate lists are\nshared across beams to maximize the parallelism; 3) Top frequent words are\nmerged into candidate lists to improve performance. Experiments on 4\nlarge-scale neural machine translation models demonstrate that our algorithm\ncan achieve up to 4x speedup on softmax module, and 2x overall speedup without\nhurting BLEU on GPU.",
