  "abstract": "The semantic image segmentation task presents a trade-off between test time\naccuracy and training-time annotation cost. Detailed per-pixel annotations\nenable training accurate models but are very time-consuming to obtain,\nimage-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less\naccurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards\nstronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We\nincorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in\nthe training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL\nVOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision\nand objectness potential yields an improvement of 12.9% mIOU over image-level\nsupervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with point-level\nsupervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level,\nsquiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget.",
