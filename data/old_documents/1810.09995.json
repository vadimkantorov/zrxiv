  "abstract": "  Most previous work on neural text generation from graph-structured data\nrelies on standard sequence-to-sequence methods. These approaches linearise the\ninput graph to be fed to a recurrent neural network. In this paper, we propose\nan alternative encoder based on graph convolutional networks that directly\nexploits the input structure. We report results on two graph-to-sequence\ndatasets that empirically show the benefits of explicitly encoding the input\ngraph structure.\n",
