  "abstract": "  We focus on the task of multi-hop reading comprehension where a system is\nrequired to reason over a chain of multiple facts, distributed across multiple\npassages, to answer a question. Inspired by graph-based reasoning, we present a\npath-based reasoning approach for textual reading comprehension. It operates by\ngenerating potential paths across multiple passages, extracting implicit\nrelations along this path, and composing them to encode each path. The proposed\nmodel achieves a 2.3% gain on the WikiHop Dev set as compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art and, as a side-effect, is also able to explain its reasoning\nthrough explicit paths of sentences.\n",
