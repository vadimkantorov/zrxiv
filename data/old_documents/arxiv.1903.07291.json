  "abstract": "We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for\nsynthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous\nmethods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which\nis then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and\nnonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization\nlayers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we\npropose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization\nlayers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on\nseveral challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method\nover existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with\ninput layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and\nstyle as synthesizing images. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE .",
