  "abstract": "The performance of automatic speech recognition systems under noisy\nenvironments still leaves room for improvement. Speech enhancement or feature\nenhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually\nadd components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In\nthis work, we propose the use of a relatively simple curriculum training\nstrategy called accordion annealing (ACCAN). It uses a multi-stage training\nschedule where samples at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values as low as 0dB are\nfirst added and samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up\nto an SNR value of 50dB. We also use a method called per-epoch noise mixing\n(PEM) that generates noisy training samples online during training and thus\nenables dynamically changing the SNR of our training data. Both the ACCAN and\nthe PEM methods are evaluated on a end-to-end speech recognition pipeline on\nthe Wall Street Journal corpus. ACCAN decreases the average word error rate\n(WER) on the 20dB to -10dB SNR range by up to 31.4% when compared to a\nconventional multi-condition training method.",
