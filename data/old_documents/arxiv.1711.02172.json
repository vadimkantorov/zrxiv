  "abstract": "  Cytoskeletal filaments are capable of self-assembly in the absence of\nexternally supplied chemical energy, but the rapid turnover rates essential for\ntheir biological function require a constant flux of ATP or GTP hydrolysis. The\nsame is true for protein assemblies employed in the formation of vesicles from\ncellular membranes, which rely on ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes to rapidly\ndisassemble upon completion of the process. Recent observations suggest that\nthe nucleolus, p granules and other mebraneless organelles may also demand\ndissipation of chemical energy to maintain their fluidity. We present a minimal\nmodel to study the relationships among dissipation, binding energy and rates of\nturnover or disassembly in a self-limiting assembly process with active monomer\nremoval. After confirming that significant kinetic acceleration can be obtained\nunder physiological parameters without melting the structure, we identify a new\nsignature of far-from-equilibrium dynamics in the fluctuations of the assembled\nphase.\n",
