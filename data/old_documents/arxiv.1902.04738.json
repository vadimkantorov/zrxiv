  "abstract": "  Programs written in C/C++ can suffer from serious memory fragmentation,\nleading to low utilization of memory, degraded performance, and application\nfailure due to memory exhaustion. This paper introduces Mesh, a plug-in\nreplacement for malloc that, for the first time, eliminates fragmentation in\nunmodified C/C++ applications. Mesh combines novel randomized algorithms with\nwidely-supported virtual memory operations to provably reduce fragmentation,\nbreaking the classical Robson bounds with high probability. Mesh generally\nmatches the runtime performance of state-of-the-art memory allocators while\nreducing memory consumption; in particular, it reduces the memory of\nconsumption of Firefox by 16% and Redis by 39%.\n",
