  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a fully supervised speaker diarization approach,\nnamed unbounded interleaved-state recurrent neural networks (UIS-RNN). Given\nextracted speaker-discriminative embeddings (a.k.a. d-vectors) from input\nutterances, each individual speaker is modeled by a parameter-sharing RNN,\nwhile the RNN states for different speakers interleave in the time domain. This\nRNN is naturally integrated with a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant\nprocess (ddCRP) to accommodate an unknown number of speakers. Our system is\nfully supervised and is able to learn from examples where time-stamped speaker\nlabels are annotated. We achieved a 7.6% diarization error rate on NIST SRE\n2000 CALLHOME, which is better than the state-of-the-art method using spectral\nclustering. Moreover, our method decodes in an online fashion while most\nstate-of-the-art systems rely on offline clustering.",
