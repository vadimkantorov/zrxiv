  "abstract": "We present an attention-based sequence-to-sequence neural network which can\ndirectly translate speech from one language into speech in another language,\nwithout relying on an intermediate text representation. The network is trained\nend-to-end, learning to map speech spectrograms into target spectrograms in\nanother language, corresponding to the translated content (in a different\ncanonical voice). We further demonstrate the ability to synthesize translated\nspeech using the voice of the source speaker. We conduct experiments on two\nSpanish-to-English speech translation datasets, and find that the proposed\nmodel slightly underperforms a baseline cascade of a direct speech-to-text\ntranslation model and a text-to-speech synthesis model, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of the approach on this very challenging task.",
